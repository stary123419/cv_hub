# CV Hub — Project Info

## Overview

CV Hub is a static, data-driven personal professional website built with Astro.

The project replaces traditional resume formats and no-code builders (e.g. Tilda)
with a version-controlled, extensible and automation-friendly solution.

It provides:
- A main CV page
- A Showcase page with projects and case studies
- Multi-language support (RU / EN)
- Downloadable resume formats (PDF / DOCX / TXT — generated from YAML at build time)

The core idea: **Single Source of Truth via YAML.**

---

## Goals

1. Maintain resume content in structured YAML format
2. Render website pages directly from structured data
3. Enable automatic generation of downloadable resume files
4. Keep the architecture minimal (2 pages only)
5. Make it easy to extend and fork for other developers

---

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- Astro (static site generator)
- YAML content collections
- Minimal CSS with CSS variables (token-based)
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

- `summary` supports multi-line YAML block scalar (`>`)
- `contacts` — `url` for email must start with `mailto:`
- `skills` — `group` is the category label; `items` is a flat list
- `experience.description` — accepts either a list (rendered as bullets) or a plain string
- `experience.stack` — rendered as tags below the description

        src: /media/projects/project-name/cover.jpg

```

### Field notes

- `order` — numeric sorting priority (lower value = shown earlier; missing values go last)
- All fields are optional by schema design — missing fields are not rendered
- `theme` — predefined CSS token (`blue`, `purple`, `emerald`, `red`, etc.)
- `accent` — HEX color override, takes precedence over `theme`
- `metrics.source` — optional proof link, not displayed visually
- `links.type` — semantic only (`repo`, `demo`, `store`, `article`); affects icon if implemented
- `media.src` — path relative to `/public`
- Broken media files are automatically removed from rendering

## Home Page Layout — How to Reorder Blocks

The main page (EN and RU) is assembled via the shared `HomePage.astro` component.

- `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/ru.astro`:
  - read data from `cv/en.yaml` / `cv/ru.yaml`
  - prepare resume download links
  - call `<HomePage lang=... data=... pdfUrl=... docxUrl=... txtUrl=... />`
- All markup and block order live in `src/components/HomePage.astro`

### Two-column layout

- Left column — `aside.sidebar`
- Right column — `main.main-content`

Each major block is a separate `<article>` or `<section>` with a comment.

**Left column (`sidebar`):**
- **Download resume** — PDF / DOCX / TXT buttons
- **Skills** — grouped by category

**Right column (`main-content`):**
- **Hero** — name, title, summary, contacts
- **Achievements** — if present in YAML
- **Experience** — timeline

To change block order:
1. Open `src/components/HomePage.astro`
2. Find the relevant block by its comment
3. Move the `<article>` / `<section>` up or down within `aside` or `main`
4. To hide a block — delete or comment it out

Language logic (`lang`) and UI strings (`t.*`) live inside `HomePage.astro` — EN/RU pages only pass data in, no markup duplication.

## Why This Approach

Traditional resume formats create duplication:
- Website version
- PDF version
- DOC version
- LinkedIn version

CV Hub centralizes everything into one YAML file, reduces duplication, enables automation, and keeps you independent from any platform.

---

## Philosophy

Treat your resume as infrastructure.

Version-controlled.
Composable.
Automatable.
Portable.

This repository is designed to be forked and adapted by any specialist who wants
full control over their professional presentation.
